# SSHman  
_Excessively simple SSH connection manager written in Python_


------

SSHman is a very basic command line utility for quickly viewing and accessing SSH connection details.  
I wrote this mainly for my own use at work. My previous method of managing SSH session details was via aliases which is obviously not ideal. Other solutions exist but I didn't want or need anything fancy. I just wanted something wildly simple and light. So I wrote this.
